Intuitively, I think that setting the action without running it will not propagate the 
initial values into the circuit

In that case, then inputs would ALL be initialized to 0 by (make-wire)
At the very least, they won't know when they CHANGE from their initial state

Half adder
(half-adder a b s c)
(or a b d)
(and a b c)
(inverter c e)
(and d e s)

Correct initial conditions
a = b = 0
d = 0
c = 0
e = 1 <------ the fallacious (accept-action-procedure!) has this missing
s = 0


Then (set-signal!) kicks a = 1, which would propagate down the system
d -> 1 correctly
c remains 0 correctly
but since c didn't CHANGE, neither does e, and it remains e = 0 INCORRECTLY
finally, s = d and e won't trigger to 1 correctly.

Now, if there were no inverters, there would be no problem with a 0 initial state everywhere...
