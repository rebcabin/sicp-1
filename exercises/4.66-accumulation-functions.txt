Ben has realized that some queries, like wheel, will return duplicate entries
This will cause double (or multiple) accumulation of their values
If only there were some way to guarantee the accumulation is over PEOPLE instead of queries...

I DON'T think this problem is runnable without modifying the query system...?

OR have the mapping function extract value + person, then filter out duplicates somehow??

OR have a query type that doesn't return frames with identical values?

Is it possible to devise a QUERY that does this?? 
	probably not... frames are independent, right?
	MAYBE using lisp-value to implement a history? (lisp-value seems dangerously powerful...)
	yeah, this works - see 4.65
