"The general idea is that the system should maintain some sort of history of its current 
chain of deductions and should not begin processing a query that it is already working on."

Well you could maintain a global list of your current queries,
and before starting a new query, scan the global list to make sure you're not stuck in a loop

If you ARE stuck in a loop, should the system raise an error? Or just return no value? hmm

To avoid the simple loop from Exercise 4.64, you just need to store the pattern
	(outranked-by ?middle-manager ?boss)
	hmm, but then the CORRECT version would fail?	

Now, for the loop type in the section, you definitely  need to store the INSTANTIATED pattern
	(married Mickey ?who)
	does that require storing all the frames up to that point? 
	you could just cache the instantiated pattern...?


Sounds like this'd eat a lot of storage...
