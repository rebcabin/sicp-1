"Devise a way to fix this shortcoming."

Uh...what you say in the problem statement sounds good...

Basically, the idea they hint at is to treat filters (not and lisp-value) differently.
- move all filters to the highest priority in an (and).
- if they have no unbound variables, filter immediately!
- if there are unbound variables, queue them for later
- do this for all filters
- apply the next non-filter query
- cycle through all filters again
