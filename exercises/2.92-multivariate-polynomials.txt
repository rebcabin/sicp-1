I THINK what they want is for something like

(add 
    (make-polynomial 'x '((1 1)))
    (make-polynomial 'y '((1 1)))
)

to return something meaningful.

What exactly do they mean "imposing an ordering on variables"?

Well, from the text:
"""
One can impose a towerlike structure on this by ordering the variables and thus always 
converting any polynomial to a ``canonical form'' with the highest-priority variable dominant
 and the lower-priority variables buried in the coefficients. 
This strategy works fairly well, except that the conversion may expand a polynomial unnecessarily, 
making it hard to read and perhaps less efficient to work with.
"""

The "multivariate" extension from exercise 2.87 doesn't seem THAT hard...
So by "not easy" they are probably referring to the "canonical form" converter...

MEH!
