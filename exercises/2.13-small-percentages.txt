Can I use my width notes from Exercise 2.9? No, I don't think it's in the right form...

±

Assume 
x, y, dx, dy > 0
dx/x << 1
dy/y << 1

product = (x ± dx)(y ± dy) = xy ± (x dy + y dx) + dx dy
product / (xy) = 1 ± (dy/y + dx/x) + (dx/x) (dy/y)
	≈ 1 ± (dy/y + dx/x)     if you neglect the second order term

Thus, percentage tolerances will approximately ADD when you multiply intervals,
when the tolerances are small.
