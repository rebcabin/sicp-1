; I guess output the object code to file as in 5.35, and analyze by diff?
; should just be ordering differences
; how am i supposed to run this code?? 
    ; should i come back and finish this after reading 5.5.7?
    ; should i look at "load-eceval-compiler"?
    ; either way, i'm not doing this on my tiny netbook screen at howdy honda...
