I'm not sure... couldn't you have an arbitrary order WITHIN the same time slice?



0,1 -> 1,0

FIFO order
0->1 for the first argument causes a transient 1 output
1->0 for the second argument causes a transient 0 output after that

but is this desirable??

well, i guess you can only trigger one action at a time, so this WOULD be more faithful

LIFO order
0->1 pushed
1->0 pushed
1->0 takes effect: AND output stays 0
0->1 takes effect: AND output stays 0


aha, sols are much more illuminating http://community.schemewiki.org/?sicp-ex-3.32

((lambda () (set-signal! output 0)) (lambda () (set-signal! output 1))) 
  
 If the execution order of the above action list changed, 
the final result of output will be different.
