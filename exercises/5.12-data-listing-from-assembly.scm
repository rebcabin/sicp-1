;Extend the assembler to store the following information in the machine model:
; a list of all instructions, with duplicates removed, sorted by instruction type (assign, goto, and so on);
    ; table of lists
    ; it doesn't ask for the instructions to be sorted WITHIN a type, so no need to dig back to chapter 2 for sorted lists
    ; not that easy... do this at the beginning of (make-execution-procedure)
        ; must be done for EVERY instruction
        ; could do this in (update-insts!), but the syntax there is whacked
        ; could do this in (assemble) or earlier, but then you'd have to identify and ignore labels.
        ; could do this in (make-instruction), but then you'd have to pass machine in somehow.

; a list (without duplicates) of the registers used to hold entry points (these are the registers referenced by goto instructions);
    ; easy! do this at the beginning of the register case in (make-goto).

; a list (without duplicates) of the registers that are saved or restored
    ; easy! do this at the beginning of (make-save) and (make-restore).

; for each register, a list (without duplicates) of the sources from which it is assigned 
; (for example, the sources for register val in the factorial machine of figure 5.11 are 
; (const 1) and ((op *) (reg n) (reg val))). 
    ; do this at the beginning of (make-assign)

    
; but the question is how to do all of this effectively and consistently...
    ; b and c are easy - you're just appending register names into an instruction-specific list
        ; share this operation between b and c!
    ; d is similar, but you need one list PER REGISTER
        ; in other words, a 2-d table
        ; if you look up the register's list, you could use the operation from b/c...
            ; provided that you use (member) to test for uniqueness and not (memq)
    ; a is actually similar to d, except that the table rows are KNOWN from p. 513.
    
    ; could create a gigantic merged 2-d table, but there MIGHT be name collisions from register names
    ; should probably create 2 1-d tables and 2 2-d tables (start by testing the former)
