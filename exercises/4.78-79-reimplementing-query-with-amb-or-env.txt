I see what they mean - you could conceivably implement an entire frame system for rule vars.
Much more overhead, right?
In ch4-mceval.scm, this was implemented as nested environments, with lots of lookup overhead

No idea about the open-ended question

Has ANYBODY posted a solution to this??
Wouldn't it be funny if somebody actually titled their dissertation "a solution to SICP 4.79"?
