I just have to point out that their torturous discussion on p. 231 just says that
"before set!, we could initialize variables, but we couldn't MODIFY them"
- so of course you could substitute the same value everywhere previously...

MOV AX, BX ; assignment is a FUNDAMENTAL operation - to work without it in a programming language is PERVERSE AT BEST

I guess their point that it is nevertheless Turing complete to work in a purely functional programming language
It just makes things that much harder for the end user
But things will be easier for people writing the compiler/interpreter? Good for you...

I think a Pragmatic Programmer would use WHATEVER mode of expression was the clearest,
be it functional, imperative, object-oriented, or anything else...
