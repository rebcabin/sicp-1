This book is INCREDIBLY well copy-edited...

Section 2.2 p. 98
"The ability to create pairs... is the essence of list structure's importance"
- shouldn't it be "the list structure's" or "list structures'"?

Section 2.2.4 p. 126 they do it again... maybe "list structure" is plural??
"arbitrarily complicated list structure [sic]"

Section 2.3.2 p. 147 "...many ways to use list structure [sic] to..."

I GUESS it's intentional...

BUT what about 
Section 5.3.2 p. 541 Footnote 15: 
"some structure is more volatile and other structure is more permanent"

-------------------

Section 3.1 p. 218: a run on sentence? "each of which has" - shouldn't this be "each of which having"

Section 3.1.3 p. 232: -15 not italicized, and "expresssion" [sic]. both fixed in web version...

Section 3.5.5 p. 356: "the implementation a banking system [sic]". fixed on website.

Section 4.3 p. 412: "This is expressed by following procedure [sic]". NOT fixed on website!

Section 5.1.4 p. 509: "the old contents of val is not useful [sic]". NOT fixed on website!
- also, no paragraph break on web version

Section 5.1.4 p. 511 Figure 5.11: there should be no data line from n to val.
- (assign val (op *) (reg n) (reg val)) - that's the feedback line from the SW.
- (assign val (const 1)) - that's the initialization line from the top
- there's NO THIRD ASSIGN statement for val, let alone one directly from n!
- "copy/paste" error from the preceding gcd diagrams?

Section 5.3.2 p. 540 Footnote 13: "3 x 10^13, microseconds" [comma should be deleted]

-------------------

Exercise 2.52a p. 141 - finally, a spacing error (2 spaces between "exercise" and "2.49")
- also present in the web full text

Exercise 4.27 p. 406 - the (define w ...) line should go above "Give the missing values"
