This book is INCREDIBLY well copy-edited...

Section 2.2 p. 98
"The ability to create pairs... is the essence of list structure's importance"
- shouldn't it be "the list structure's" or "list structures'"?

Section 2.2.4 p. 126 they do it again... maybe "list structure" is plural??
"arbitrarily complicated list structure [sic]"

Section 2.3.2 p. 147 "...many ways to use list structure [sic] to..."

I GUESS it's intentional...

Section 3.1 p. 218: a run on sentence? "each of which has" - shouldn't this be "each of which having"

Section 3.1.3 p. 232: -15 not italicized, and "expresssion" [sic]. both fixed in web version...

Section 3.5.5 p. 356: "the implementation a banking system [sic]". fixed on website.
-------------------

Exercise 2.52a p. 141 - finally, a spacing error (2 spaces between "exercise" and "2.49")
- also present in the web full text

Exercise 4.27 p. 406 - the (define w ...) line should go above "Give the missing values"
