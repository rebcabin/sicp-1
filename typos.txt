This book is INCREDIBLY well copy-edited...

Section 2.2 p. 98
"The ability to create pairs... is the essence of list structure's importance"
- shouldn't it be "the list structure's" or "list structures'"?

Section 2.2.4 p. 126 they do it again... maybe "list structure" is plural??
"arbitrarily complicated list structure [sic]"
